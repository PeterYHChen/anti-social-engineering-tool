            <h2 class="chapter-title">SOCIAL ENGINEERING PREVENTION for EVERYONE</h2>
            <p>Do you know about <mark class="blue">SOCIAL ENGINEERING</mark> on the <mark class="blue">INTERNET</mark>? You should, especially if you are old or very young.</p>
            <p>Else, your money may be lost; you may do something that you don't mean to; or some person may try to take your things.</p>
            <p>If you are on a <mark class="blue">COMPUTER</mark> or <mark class="blue">PHONE</mark>, you need to check what you do. You need to check what you <mark class="blue">CLICK</mark> and open. The INTERNET is a big place, fun and cool, but also with many people trying to do bad things. These bad people can come to you, and they can try to do something to take your money or <mark class="blue">IDENTITY</mark>. Your COMPUTER or PHONE cannot stop every danger. But most things can be okay. You can help. You just need to learn about how to be strong against SOCIAL ENGINEERING and know when you see it.</p>

              <dd>
              <em>noun</em><br>
              when people try to do bad things and <mark class="orange">TRICK</mark> you, including on the INTERNET
              </dd>
            </dl>
            <p>The main person who is in danger of a SOCIAL ENGINEERING event is about <mark>40 years old</mark>. If I am born in 1975 or before, the INTERNET and <mark class="blue">SMARTPHONES</mark> may be a new product to me, so smart people can easily TRICK me, since I do not know how to use the products as well. Same for you.</p>

            <p>We are good people that want <mark class="green">YOU</mark> to learn how to be strong against the bad people. We are students from New York University in New York city.</p>

            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p><mark class="green">First step: EMAIL</mark><mark class="orange"> has dangers!</mark></p>
            <p>EMAIL is great. We can talk to old friends from other places. But any person in the whole world can also send us an EMAIL. That means every EMAIL can have danger.</p>
            <p>Most <mark class="orange">IMPORTANT</mark>: do not open LINKS fast from people you do not know. LINKS are one of the biggest methods of TRICKING you, because they can say anything and <s>be okay</s><sup> can go somewhere that has danger.</sup></p>
             <dl>
              <dt><strong>link</strong></dt>
              <dd>
              <em>noun</em><br>
              a clickable phrase that takes your COMPUTER or PHONE to another place. Not all are bad. But not all are good.
              </dd>
            </dl>
          
            <p>If a LINK goes to another place other than the main place you are at (called a <mark class="blue">DOMAIN</mark>), then there is a chance that the LINK is not as safe. Of course, there is still a low chance. But low chance things are still dangerous if the result can be big.</p>
            <p><mark class="orange"><i>Other place = maybe less safe</i></mark></p>
            <p><mark class="blue">Example:</mark> I'm in YouTube town. I see a LINK on the page that I like. If I am in YouTube town and nothing bad has happened, YouTube town is probably safe (maybe not, but probably). Going to another place that I do not know about is a risk, because I already know YouTube town is probably safe. I do not know if the new place is safe. So, I should check and learn about the new place <mark class="orange">before</mark> I CLICK to go there.</p>
            <p><mark class="green">Second step: </mark>even a <mark class="green">safe</mark> place can have a <mark class="orange">danger</mark>!</p>
            <p>The way you get to the place matters - if a person gives you an EMAIL with a LINK, they sometimes have the power to do something because the LINK can tell your COMPUTER to do different things.</p>
            <p><mark class="blue">Example:</mark> I'm in Facebook town. I see a LINK on the page that I like. But it is from a person. That person could include bad things in the LINK, even if the LINK place is safe. I need to check if the link is safe first.</p>
            <p><mark class="green">Third step: friends can tell each other mistakes they learn.</mark></p>
            <p>If you have friends to tell you if a place is safe because they have already been there, then that is better than knowing nothing about the place.</p>
            <p><mark class="blue">Example:</mark> If Buzzfeed town is bad, maybe some people have visited there before, and they can tell others it is bad.</p>
            <p><mark class="orange">Three things</mark>: other places are sometimes less safe, LINKS can be bad if we do not learn about them, and bad places can be put on a list to keep you safer. <br><br>We can make these practices better by using a tool. <a href="book_C.html">Click here for the tool! </a> (You have to trust that this link is safe).</p>
