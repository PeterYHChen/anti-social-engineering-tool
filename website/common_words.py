"Do you know about SOCIAL ENGINEERING on the INTERNET? You should, especially if you are old or very young." 

"Else, your money may be lost; you may do something that you don't mean to; or some person may try to take your things."

"If you are on a COMPUTER or PHONE, you need to check what you do. You need to check what you CLICK and open. The INTERNET is a big place, fun and cool, but also with many people trying to do bad things. These bad people can come to you, and they can try to do something to take your money or IDENTITY. Your COMPUTER or PHONE cannot stop every danger. But most things can be okay. You can help. You just need to learn about how to be strong against SOCIAL ENGINEERING and know when you see it."

"SOCIAL ENGINEERING - when people try to do bad things and TRICK you on the INTERNET"

"The main person who is in danger of a SOCIAL ENGINEERING event is about 40 years old. If I am born in 1975 or before, the INTERNET and SMARTPHONES may be a new product to me, so smart people can easily TRICK me, since I do not know how to use the products as well. Same for you."

"We are good people that want YOU to learn how to be strong against the bad people. We are students from New York University in New York city."

"First step: EMAIL has dangers!"

"EMAIL is great. We can talk to old friends from other places. But any person in the whole world can also send us an EMAIL. That means every EMAIL can have danger. "

"Most IMPORTANT: do not open LINKS from people you do not know. LINKS are one of the biggest methods of TRICKING you, because they can say one thing but go somewhere else."

"LINK - a clickable phrase that takes your COMPUTER or PHONE to another place. Not all are bad. But not all are good."

"If a LINK goes to another place other than the main place you are at (DOMAIN), then there is a chance that the LINK is not as safe. Of course, there is still a low chance. But low chance things are still dangerous if the result can be big."

	"Other place = maybe less safe"
